abstract="The twenty-first century has been an era of technological advances that has surpassed previous decades. This is largely due to the level of innovation in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. However, learners are often reluctant to choose computer programming (coding) as a subject due to its perceived difficulty. Nevertheless, it is also well known that learners who are introduced to computer programming at a young age become the computer science university graduates of tomorrow. Learners' hesitancy towards computer programming is due to the complex, abstract nature of the discipline. To this end, innovative toolsInnovative tools         are proving useful for learners to overcome such barriers. This chapter provides effective strategies to teach the fundamental concepts of computer programming using robotics, specifically Lego Mindstorms robots. The approach taken is hands-on, student-centred and visual. Learners develop coding solutions through designing and coding real-world problems, visually correcting their imprecisions. This chapter includes learning activities and practical examples from case studies. The inequality of women in the workplace, especially women in IT, is also addressed. A discussion around effective approaches to teaching girls' coding is included as research indicates that girls' learning requirements for coding are different to those of boys.",

abstract="Context: Robotics has assisted teachers to combine technologyTechnology         and engineering topics to concretize science and mathematics conceptsConcepts         in real-world applications. As a result, benefits in different concepts and skills, as well as positive long-term effects, have been observed. Objective: This work aims to identify state-of-the-art robotics applications to support STEM teaching. To do so, we intend to answer six research questions: (1) What concepts are considered and how are they explored? (2) What skills are expected to be developed? (3) How is educational robotics associated with school curriculum? (4) What types of robots are used? (5) What age groups/educational levels are considered? (6) How is educational robotics evaluated? Method: We carried out a systematic literature reviewReview         to identify, assess, and synthesize relevant papers published from 2013. A protocol developed by us guided the review conduction and enhanced its repeatability with reduced subjectivity. Results: 60 publications able to answer the research questions were summarized. We found that: (1) several STEM concepts have been explored in all educational levels; (2) educational robotics is still frequently associated with teamwork and problem-solving development, extracurricular activities, and LEGO robots; (3) only 25{\%} of the 60 papers quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated learning. Conclusion: Robots support for STEM education has been successful in different scenarios. The inherent flexibility, coupled with the experiences reported by a significant piece of the literature, can inspire new applications of educational robotics.",
